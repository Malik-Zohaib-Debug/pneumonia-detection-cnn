# pneumonia-detection-cnn-lstm
University final year project created with the help of deep learning algorithms (CNN, LSTM) that can do detection, classification and segmentation of pneumonia using x-ray images.  It's a multi-class classification problem and basically a research based project.

We gathered a dataset from different sources and created our own custom dataset. The dataset is based on multi-classfication problem.
If you need access to the dataset contact me on my gmail address.
