<h3>Title: Pneumonia Classification and Segmentation using Deep Learning and Techniques<h3>

University final year project created with the help of deep learning algorithms (CNN, LSTM) that can do detection, classification and segmentation of pneumonia using x-ray images.  It's a multi-class classification problem and 
basically a research based project.

We train multiple deep learning models on a custom created dataset. The dataset is based on 3 classes Bacterial, Viral and Normal. Because of more than two classes the problem comes under multi-classification. Mutliple models are trained and then integrated the best performing one with our final web-application. If you need access to the dataset contact me on my gmail address.
  
We first train CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) individually and then at the end merge both of them to create one single model.
  
The backend is created using Django framework and integrate the best performing model with it.
