<h3>Title: Pneumonia Classification using Deep Learning and Techniques<h3>

University final year project created with the help of deep learning algorithms (CNN and Pretrained CNN models) that can do detection, classification and segmentation of pneumonia using x-ray images. It's a multi-class classification problem and basically a research based project.

We train multiple deep learning models on a custom created dataset. The dataset is based on 3 classes Bacterial, Viral and Normal. Because of more than two classes the problem comes under multi-classification. Mutliple models are trained and then integrated the best performing one with our final web-application. If you need access to the dataset contact me on my gmail address.
  
We created a custom CNN model first and then also trained our dataset on pretrained models like (VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50)
  
The backend is created using Django framework.
